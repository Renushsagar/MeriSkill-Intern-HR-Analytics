HR Analytics
The tasks for this project were data cleaning and data visualization. 
For data cleaning, I deleted redundant columns, renamed columns, dropped duplicates, cleaned individual columns, removed NaN values, and performed additional transformations. For data visualization, I plotted a correlation map for all numeric variables, as well as visualized overtime, marital status, job role, gender, education field, department, business travel, the relationship between overtime and age, total working years, education level, number of companies worked, and distance from home.
